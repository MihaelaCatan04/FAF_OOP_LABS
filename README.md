# OOP Laboratory Works

This repository contains the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) laboratory works completed as part of the Software Engineering curriculum (FAF) at the Technical University of Moldova. 

## Laboratory Work 0 - Papers Please

This lab is inspired by the game: Papers, Please.

The primary task in the game is for the player to decide whether to grant or deny individuals entry into the city, based on their papers data.

The lab builds on the premise, but has some modified rules and background story, for a more light-hearted experience.

## Laboratory Work 1 - Class & Objects Galore

This lab is inspired by FAF archives

The lab is a collection of object-oriented challenges, for object-oriented solutions.

You will learn: Creating multiple distinct Objects defined by the same class. List iteration, class composition and text processing.

## Laboratory Work 2 - Coffee Inheritance

This lab focuses on using inheritance to build and extend a hierarchy of classes. You'll explore class hierarchies, method overriding, and encapsulation to create a structured system of beverage-related classes, enhancing reuse and promoting clean code principles.

## Laboratory Work 3 - Car Station

This lab focuses on building a car service application that leverages abstraction, polymorphism, and composition. Inspired by real-world service workflows, the lab introduces you to the principles of clean code, interface segregation, and dependency inversion while simulating a dynamic system of serving cars.
