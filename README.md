# OOP Laboratory Works

This repository contains the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) laboratory works completed as part of the Software
Engineering curriculum (FAF) at the Technical University of Moldova. 

## Laboratory Work 0 - Classification of Creatures

This lab focuses on learning the basics of Kotlin, Git, and Object-Oriented Programming. It involves classifying
fictional creatures based on their characteristics. The tasks include setting up Git, reading JSON files, and creating
classes to represent alien species for classification purposes.

## Laboratory Work 1 - Creating Multiple Objects and Class Composition

This lab involves creating an OOP system to define multiple distinct objects using the same class. It covers topics such
as list iteration, class composition, and text processing, building a solid understanding of class design and
interaction.
