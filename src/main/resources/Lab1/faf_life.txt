Life at FAF is a wild ride â€” hard but fun. One day you're deep in code, the next you're questioning if you'll make it to the end or if the semester's gonna end you first. We don't talk about sleep here either. It's all about the hustle, late nights, and pushing limits, but somehow, it's still a vibe!
